<p>A social network and platform for competitive programming, <a href="https://codeforces.com">Codeforces</a> is a popular place for both beginners and masters alike. Users can participate in regularly held contests to climb the ladder and increase their rating.</p>

<p>While not a regular participant <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/caioicy">myself</a>, I have always been involved in competitive programming through my former university and friends made therein.</p>

<p>Recently I was browsing the website and noticed that most high-rated users had seemingly better results in the beginning of their participation than most average-rated users.</p>

<h2 id="codeforces-api">Codeforces API</h2>

<p>Wondering if this perception could be backed by data, I decided to see if there were any interesting statistics to be found through <a href="https://codeforces.com/apiHelp">Codeforces’ API</a>, using Python and lovely scientific packages like <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>, <a href="https://numpy.org/">numpy</a>, <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">scipy</a> and <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://codeforces.com/apiHelp/methods#user.ratedList">user.ratedList</a> I gathered a list of all rated users, and with <a href="https://codeforces.com/apiHelp/methods#user.rating">user.rating</a> I gathered every rating change data for each user. As a side note, I locally cached these responses to avoid making these 30k requests over and over again.</p>

<p>The code used for this can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/CaioIcy/codeforces-analysis">CaioIcy/codeforces-analysis</a></p>

<h2 id="visualization">Visualization</h2>

<p>To understand if there was any merit to my initial hypothesis I plotted every user who had ever reached the <a href="https://codeforces.com/help#q8">first division</a> (max rating &gt;= 1900), with the x-axis being a user’s maximum rating and the y-axis being the number of contests participated in order to reach div1 for the first time:</p>

<p>Interesting!</p>

<p>By glancing at the scatter plot there seems to be a correlation. Out of curiosity I searched for ways to measure just how correlated two variables really are, and landed on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient">Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient</a>. Using <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.spearmanr.html">scipy’s spearmanr</a> we have about <code class="highlighter-rouge">-0.21</code> for a correlation coefficient which means there is an observable correlation, albeit moderate, as seen in the table below:</p>

<p>To have another perspective on the data, I split the users into buckets based on their maximum rating to be able to visualize the data in a less cluttered way than the scatter plot:</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Indeed users of certain rating ranges had usually slightly better performances in their early contests when compared to lower rating ranges, but why? Well, I don’t know! There could be a myriad of reasons, and I would like to hear what <strong>you</strong> think!</p>

<p>And remember, if you blasted through your early contests in Codeforces, it does not mean that you will have a breezy time moving forward, keep studying:</p>
